# Blood Management System in C++

## 📌 Overview

The **Blood Management System in C++** is a console-based application designed to manage blood donations, donors, and recipients efficiently. It provides a structured way to store, search, and update donor and recipient records, ensuring seamless management of blood donation data.

## 🛠 Features

- Add, search, and delete donor records.
- Manage blood recipient details.
- Store blood group and availability status.
- Simple and efficient C++ file handling.
- User-friendly console interface.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **C++** - Core programming language.
- **File Handling** - Stores and retrieves data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Modular design for better management.

## 📷 Preview

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Welcome to the Blood Management System!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
blood-management-system/
│-- main.cpp    # Core application logic
│-- donors.txt  # Stores donor records
│-- recipients.txt  # Stores recipient details
```

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fatima-progmmer/Blood-management-system-in-c-.git
   ```
2. **Compile the program**
